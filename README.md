## Features:
- User-friendly GUI.
- "Next" and "Back" buttons for easy media traversal.
- "Save" button to store selected media.
- Caching viewed media so that progress is saved between sessions.
- "Select Folder" button for easy folder selection exploration.

## How to Use:
When ran, you will see three buttons at the bottom left: "Back," "Save," and "Next," each performing its respective action. When saving a file, a new directory called "VMO_Saved" will be created within the selected folder.

To the right of the 3 buttons there are 2 text lines. The bottom text line displays the selected file's name and extension, and the top line indicates "Saved!" when a file is successfully saved.

On the bottom right there are 2 buttons "Clear Cache" and "Select Folder". The "Select Folder" button prompts you to choose a folder, loading all media within for navigation. "Clear Cache" removes saved progress for files viewed in the selected folder.
