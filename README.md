Above, and to the right of the 3 buttons there are 2 text lines. The text line above reads the selected folder name and the displayed file's name.extension, and the right text line indicates "Saving..." then "Saved!" when a file is successfully saved.

On the bottom right there are 6 buttons, "Keybinds", "Clear Cache", "Select Folder", "Organize Type", "Refresh", and "Media Type":
- The "Select Folder" button prompts you to choose a folder, loading all media within the selected folder for navigation.
- "Clear Cache" removes saved progress for files viewed in the selected folder.
- "Keybinds" will open a window where you can set your keybinds/hotkeys for the "Next", "Save", "Back", and "Next Folder" buttons.
- "Organize Type" is a dropdown menu to select the method of organization/order to display files in a folder.
- "Refresh" will refresh the current display order with the selected organize type.
- "Media Type" is a drop down menu where you can choose to only display video files, image files, or both.

Above the buttons on the right there is 1 text line, this is where it will display how many files you viewed and how many files are left to view. (Ex. 15/765).
